Hello Dan,

My name is Joel. I am work for Services Support here at GitLab . I am sorry for the inconvenience. I will do my best to troubleshoot this issue. I just a few questions for you. I have listed them below.

1) Did you fill out all the fields that were required?


2)Did you meet the specific criteria for registration?.(ex  password length, special character).
 

3)Did you get the dialog message during the registration process that says "Please confirm your email"?

If you did receive this confirmation, i would check the spam folder in your inbox.

Question 3
I'm getting API error, even though I'm master on the project and can pull / fetch just fine:

$ git push origin tan 
Pushing to git@gitlab.com:Project/repo.git 
GitLab: API is not accessible

Question 5 (We do not currently allow .co signups)
Hi. I would like to create a new account with something@anything.co email address to add into our group as a CI but I get an 'Email is not from an allowed domain.' error message during the signup. 
Could you help me what I'm missing here?

I would check the blacklisted domains in your group. If your domain is blacklisted you wont be able to add it to your group.

Check out this URL which goes into detail about sign up restrictions.
